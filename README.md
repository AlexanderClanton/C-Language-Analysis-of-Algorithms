#Purpose
# The program takes command line inputs from the user such as -a to run all. Use -h to find out to run the program, a prompt will be given with the commands to print out different sorting algothrims

#The program has a variety of sorting algothrims including insertion,heap,quick, and shell (Knuth). A randomizied array generated from a user's seed is sorted and statistics about its moves and comparisons are printed to the user

#The user can decide to print out the sorted array via -p and chosen amount of elements

#beware asking for insertion on more than 10000 elements is extremely slow and may not be able to be completed onyour machine.
